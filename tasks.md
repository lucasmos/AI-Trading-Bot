# Project Tasks

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Investigated trade history not appearing, identified API returning empty array.
- [x] Added detailed logging to `handleExecuteTrade` in `src/app/page.tsx` for debugging.
- [x] Attempted database inspection and reset using Prisma Studio and database commands (encountered issues).
- [x] Improved error handling and logging in `src/app/page.tsx` for trade creation and closure.
- [x] Added a refresh button, detailed error logging, and display of user ID/last refresh time to `src/app/trade-history/page.tsx`.
- [x] Stashed local changes and pulled latest code from GitHub, revealing a switch to localStorage for trade history.
- [x] Updated `src/app/trade-history/page.tsx` to align with localStorage-based trade history.
- [x] Resolved TypeScript linter errors related to `TradeRecord` and `TradeRecordStatus` types in `src/app/trade-history/page.tsx`.
- [x] Adjusted price formatting function in `src/app/trade-history/page.tsx` to handle null/undefined values.
- [x] Reverted trade history storage to database-first approach.
- [x] Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to use API calls for creating and closing manual trades in the database.
- [x] Updated `src/app/trade-history/page.tsx` to fetch from both database and localStorage, merging and indicating sources.
- [x] Updated automated trading functions in `src/app/page.tsx` to interact with the database.
- [x] Identified and confirmed the correct `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
- [x] Ensured new trades are stored only in the database, with localStorage as a backup.
- [x] Updated `src/app/trade-history/page.tsx` to prioritize database trades and adjust UI messages.
- [x] Modified `src/lib/trade-history-utils.ts` to reflect its role as a backup system (later deleted as per new strategy).
- [x] Refactored `handleExecuteTrade` in `src/app/page.tsx` for database-first storage with localStorage fallback and specific toast messages.
- [x] Implemented user creation in the database upon Firebase authentication.
- [x] Created new API endpoint `/api/auth/verify/route.ts` to handle user existence check and creation.
- [x] Updated `AuthProvider` in `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` to call the new verification API endpoint.
- [x] Updated Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) for the `User` model.
- [x] Ran database migrations to apply schema changes.
- [x] Addressed linter errors in `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx`.
- [x] Deleted `src/middleware.ts`, `src/types.ts`, and `src/lib/trade-history-utils.ts` as part of refactoring and strategy changes.
